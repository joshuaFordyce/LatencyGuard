High-Level Implementation Steps üõ†Ô∏è
Develop the Agent: Write a Bash script (latency_check.sh) to perform simple, fast checks like ping and iostat, and a Python script (latency_analyzer.py) using a library like psutil for more detailed metrics. The Python script should be able to send its data to a central location.

Choose and Implement a Configurator: Select one tool (Salt, Puppet, or Chef) and learn its core concepts.

Salt: Write a Salt State (latency_guard.sls) that installs python-psutil, copies the scripts to /opt/latency-guard, and creates a cron job to run the agent every minute.

Puppet: Write a Puppet manifest to declare that the scripts and a cron resource should be present on all agent nodes.

Chef: Write a cookbook with a recipe that uses remote_file to download the scripts and cron_d to schedule the job.

Build the Analyzer/Remediator: Write a Python application that can ingest data (e.g., from an HTTP API endpoint the agents report to) and apply a set of rules. For example, if ping latency to a trading exchange exceeds 500 microseconds, it should trigger a remediation command.

Connect the Pieces: The Analyzer should be able to send a command to the Configurator. For instance, it could use the Salt API (salt.client.LocalClient) or a similar mechanism for Puppet or Chef to remotely execute a predefined remediation script on the problematic server.
