Background Information ðŸ“š
A production-grade, low-latency monitoring tool is not just about alerting when a system is slow. It's about building a system that understands the nuances of performance and takes proactive steps to prevent downtime.

Shell Scripting for Low Latency
Shell scripting is chosen for the agent because it's lightweight and fast. It has minimal overhead, making it ideal for running frequently in a low-latency environment where every microsecond counts. Tools like ping measure network latency, iostat measures disk I/O, and perf can profile CPU usage without significantly impacting the workload.

Configuration Management (Salt vs. Puppet vs. Chef)
These tools solve the problem of managing thousands of servers in a predictable, automated way.

Salt: Known for its speed and scalability. It uses a push-based model, where the master sends commands to minions in near real-time. This is highly beneficial for a low-latency environment where quick, on-demand changes are needed for remediation.

Puppet: Follows a declarative, pull-based model. Agents regularly pull their desired state from the master, ensuring consistency. It provides a strong, centralized view of the fleet's configuration but is less suited for immediate, real-time command execution than Salt.

Chef: Is procedural and uses Ruby-based code. It's highly flexible and powerful, allowing for complex logic and custom recipes, making it a good fit for intricate automation tasks.

The key difference for this project is the push-vs-pull model. Salt's push model is more aligned with the need for immediate remediation, while Puppet and Chef are better for enforcing a consistent state over time.

Python for Analysis and Remediation
Python is the perfect language for the analysis and remediation component. It has robust libraries like psutil for accessing system metrics, and it can easily interact with APIs for reporting and triggering commands on the configurator. Python's ability to handle data analysis and automation makes it the "brains" of the operation.
