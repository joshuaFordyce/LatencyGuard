## üåü Overview

Latency Guard is an automated, low-latency system monitoring and remediation tool designed for mission-critical, high-frequency environments. It is built to detect performance degradation in real-time, diagnose the root cause, and automatically take corrective action to ensure maximum uptime and a consistent, low-latency profile.

The project demonstrates a mastery of shell scripting, Python, and modern configuration management tools, providing a comprehensive solution for DevOps and SRE teams.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Decentralized Monitoring Agents:** Lightweight agents written in Bash and Python for non-intrusive data collection.
- **Automated Configuration Management:** Uses SaltStack (or Puppet/Chef) to automatically deploy and configure the monitoring agent on a fleet of servers.
- **Intelligent Analysis:** A Python-based analyzer identifies performance bottlenecks and triggers automated remediation.
- **Automated Remediation:** Configured to take corrective action like restarting services or clearing caches to restore performance.
- **Historical Analysis:** Integrates with Prometheus and Grafana for long-term metric storage and visualization.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and set up a local testing environment.

### Prerequisites

- A Salt/Puppet/Chef master server.
- Several agent/minion servers.
- Python 3.x with `psutil` installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/latency-guard.git](https://github.com/your-username/latency-guard.git)
    cd latency-guard
    ```
2.  **Agent Deployment:** Use your chosen configuration management tool to deploy the agent scripts and configure the cron job.

## üíª Usage

The `latency_check.sh` script can be run manually for testing:

```bash
./latency_check.sh
