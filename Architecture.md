Architecture üèõÔ∏è
The architecture for "Latency Guard" is a decentralized data collection, centralized configuration, and automated remediation model. It's designed to be robust and non-intrusive.

Agent (Client): The monitoring agent is a suite of scripts that lives on each server. It's designed to be as lightweight as possible to avoid adding to the very latency it's monitoring. The agent collects key system metrics and, crucially, performance metrics of the specific low-latency workload.

Configurator (Master): A central server running either Salt, Puppet, or Chef. This server acts as the control plane for the entire fleet. It is responsible for the initial deployment of the agent, ensuring the agent is always up to date, and providing a mechanism to trigger automated remediation.

Analyzer/Remediator (Logic): A dedicated Python application or a set of microservices that runs on a separate machine. This component receives metrics from all the agents, analyzes them for anomalies, and, if necessary, sends a command back to the Configurator to initiate a remediation action.
